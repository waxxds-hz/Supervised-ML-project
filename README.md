# Supervised-ML-project
## HEPMASS Particle Classification
This project explores machine learning algorithms in high energy physics data analysis, classifying particle collisions using AdaBoost and logistic regression.
## Files
- `Supervised_Learning_Final_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and model results.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
- `test_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for testing. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
- `train_subset.csv`: Small samples of the dataset used for training. This is sampled from events with fixed mass = 1000.
